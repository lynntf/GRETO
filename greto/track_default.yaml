# Default settings for gamma-ray tracking

DETECTOR: gretina               # Available detectors are "GRETINA", "GRETA" (identical to "GRETINA"), and "AGATA"
COINCIDENCE_TIME_GAP: &tg 40    # Units of 10 ns; Used for grouping recorded crystal events in time
NUM_PROCESSES: 3                # Number of processors to use for multi-processing (should be changed depending on the machine)
SECONDARY_ORDER: false          # USE FOR DATA COMPARISONS ONLY; Track twice; Used for ensuring comparison between the the same data tracked two different ways (only differs in order)
VERBOSITY: 2                    # Level of console output;
TIMEOUT_SECONDS: 15             # Timeout limit in seconds for multiprocessing processes
MAX_HIT_POINTS: 300             # Maximum number of hit points for constructed events (experiment/data dependent)
GLOBAL_COORDS: false            # USE FOR SIMULATED DATA ONLY; If the data is provided with global coordinates already, skip the transformation from crystal coordinates to global
MONSTER_SIZE: &monster 8        # Maximum size of a cluster; clusters larger than the "monster" size are not tracked
PARTIAL_TRACK: false            # DO NOT USE; Should tracking bail after determining the first interaction points? (Possibly useful when performing double tracking because only the first interactions are recorded in mode1 data)
SAVE_INTERMEDIATE: false        # DO NOT USE; Save an intermediate file format instead of mode1 (events and clusters stored by pickle)
SAVE_EXTENDED_MODE1: false      # Save a mode1 file with all interactions recorded
REEVALUATE_FOM: false           # Reevaluate the FOM values according to the eval_FOM_kwargs; Used in conversion, not tracking
order_FOM_kwargs:               # Arguments for ordering interactions (recorded in mode1)
  fom_method: selected          # FOM method for ordering; Available methods are "oft"/"agata", "aft"/"angle", "selected" (ML optimized for ordering), "model"
  model_filename: null          # Filename of the model
  singles_method: depth         # How to handle single interactions for ordering (not ordered)
  width: 5                      # How many interactions to consider in the forward direction in the enumeration of possible tracks
  stride: 2                     # How many interactions to accept after each enumeration step
  max_cluster_size: *monster    # Maximum cluster size for tracking (should be the same as the monster size, but can be different)
secondary_order_FOM_kwargs:     # If ordering twice (double tracking), reorder the data for recording a FOM as if ordered in this way in mode1
  fom_method: angle             # FOM method for ordering
  model_filename: null          # Filename of the model
  singles_method: depth         # How to handle single interactions for ordering (not ordered)
  width: 5                      # How many interactions to consider in the forward direction in the enumeration of possible tracks
  stride: 2                     # How many interactions to accept after each enumeration step
  max_cluster_size: *monster    # Maximum cluster size for tracking (should be the same as the monster size, but can be different)
eval_FOM_kwargs:                # Suppression FOM. What FOM should be recorded in mode1? Not used if double tracking.
  fom_method: angle             # FOM method for recording in mode1
  model_filename: null          # Filename of the model
  singles_method: depth         # Singles method for recording in mode1; Available methods are "depth" (identical to AFT treatment), "range" (similar to AFT treatment using a continuous function to determine ranges), "probability" (range probability is returned), "continuous" (linear attenuation * distance)
  max_cluster_size: *monster    # Maximum cluster size for tracking, determines if the gamma ray is considered tracked or not (should match the tracking options)
cluster_kwargs:                 # How should interactions be clustered?
  alpha_degrees: 20             # Cone clustering alpha in degrees
  time_gap: *tg                 # Time gap for clustering; interactions with timestamps differing by more than the time gap have the distance between them set to infinity (can still be clustered together if there is an interaction bridging the time gap)
